### Powerful yet simple-to-use solutions for all users

With Organized, no one is left behind. This app is designed for both those responsible for creating schedules and reports — like meeting or public talk overseers and secretaries — and the publishers who benefit from having meeting details on hand in a moment's notice.

**For meeting overseers and secretaries:** Whether you’re entering congregation attendance records during a meeting in the Kingdom Hall, generating secretary reports, or setting up entire meeting schedules, Organized allows you to accomplish these tasks right from your mobile device. Even if you’re commuting, out in the ministry, or have a few spare minutes in the day, you can handle your responsibilities without needing a desktop computer.

**For publishers:** With Organized, publishers can check meeting schedules and assignments anytime, directly from their personal smartphone or tablet. This ensures they’re always informed and ready, with access to the most up-to-date information, providing peace of mind for every congregation member.

**For pioneers:** Organized provides a dedicated set of tools specifically for auxiliary pioneers and full-time servants, including a ministry timer and a "My Bible studies" feature. These tools enhance your ministry experience by making it easy to track the service hours (including hours spent on schools and approved theocratic assignments such as LDC, HLC, work for Bethel, etc.) and effectively manage Bible studies, allowing them to focus on their important work for Jehovah with confidence and ease.

Organized’s flexibility makes it a powerful tool, especially for those who manage congregation schedules, reports, speakers, and other records. The full functionality of the app is available across devices, so you don’t have to worry about different versions for different operating systems — simply access the tools you need, wherever you are and whenever you need them.

### Enjoy full functionality on any device

What makes Organized a great software solution is its versatility across different devices. All features are designed to work seamlessly on any platform, whether you're using a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer. While some features, like the full month view for meeting scheduling (due to the limitations of how much content can fit on smaller screens), can be enjoyed only on larger screens such as desktops, you can still access them on larger tablets without any issues. The app is designed to adapt smoothly to any device, ensuring that all essential tasks can be performed easily and comfortably on mobile devices too.

Since Organized is not a web-based app, it doesn’t require a constant internet connection, making it even more reliable. This means you can work with confidence, knowing that your congregation data is always available, whether you’re at the Kingdom Hall or in the ministry.
