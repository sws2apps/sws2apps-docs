### Digital and print meeting scheduling approaches

For a long time, Jehovah's Witnesses have used paper to organize their meetings and schedules and even the whole preaching work worldwide. It was the best way to keep things in order before computers were around. One brother would make the schedule, fill it out or print it, and then put it up on the information board. But now, many brothers are using digital tools to make scheduling easier. Some use spreadsheets, computer programs, or mobile apps, while others still prefer pen and paper. Our team created the Organized app to bring together the best of both worlds – digital and paper.

In this article, you'll learn about the benefits of using both digital and print meeting schedules and how the Organized app can help you do just that in the most convenient way possible. So, keep reading to discover how to make your meeting scheduling more efficient and stress-free!

### Why not use the best of both methods?

The Organized app is designed to assist responsible brothers in creating and managing meeting schedules, duties and another responsibilities for their congregation. With its user-friendly interface, the app makes it easy for you to create midweek and weekend meeting schedules, either directly in the app or by filling out assignments that you've already created on paper. The Autofill feature allows you to quickly fill out new data, view everything at a glance, and access it from anywhere, making it a convenient tool for busy brothers on-the-go.

But what sets Organized apart is its flexibility in supporting both digital and print approaches. We understand that some brothers prefer the traditional paper method, while others prefer the convenience of digital apps. That's why we've made it possible for you to use both approaches, without having to sacrifice one for the other!

### How exactly does it work?

After you've made your schedule in the app, the Organized app provides you with both options, again. You can first publish it for all Organized app users in your congregation. This way, they can easily see it, check for updates, and be prepared for their meeting assignments and duties. Also, you can export beautiful print-ready schedules for your congregation. Afterwards, you can either send it out as PDF or print and put it onto an information board in your Kingdom Hall. The app has professionally designed templates for midweek and weekend meetings (official S-140 one as well as custom meeting templates designed by our team), so you can create a polished and neat schedule with ease. And the best part is that you don't have to fill out the PDF print templates separately. The Organized app does it automatically, saving you time and effort.

With the Organized app, you don't have to choose between digital and print. Instead, you can let other brothers and all publishers in your congregation benefit from the approach that works best for them. By using both digital and print meeting schedules, everyone in your congregation can stay informed and prepared for their assignments, no matter their preference. The app is designed to help responsible brothers first, but it also allows all congregation members to benefit from having all the schedules in one convenient place.

### Export anything in a click

Organized allows you to export all your congregation's data into PDF print-ready formats with just a click. This includes not only midweek and weekend meeting schedules, but also all key forms used by every congregation in the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses. For example, you can export Territory Map Card (S-12), Territory Assignment Record (S-13), Congregation’s Publisher Record (S-21), Public Talk Record (S-99), and even more forms are in development. 

Also, Organized app has various templates for different aspects of a congregation life: Hall cleaning schedule, Meetings for field service, Meeting duties, Upcoming events, Field service groups, Circuit overseer visit schedule, different variations of meeting schedules and more! All of them are easy to read and are as user-friendly as our app, ensuring you have beautiful printed schedules, announcements, and other important information without spending too much of your time.

This approach allows you to easily use Organized and export all the data records in a few easy clicks, meaning that we don't lock you inside of the Organized app, but allow you to flexibly manage all the data of your congregation, and then save or print it if you want. Use the app in a way that suits you and your congregation the best! So feel free to take a look at the app without fear loosing or of being unable to later export the data.
