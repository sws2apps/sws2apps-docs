# Support Organized growth with your donation

We’re working hard to make Organized better every day, and your donations help us do just that. By contributing, you help cover essential costs like keeping our servers running smoothly, allowing us to focus on adding new features and improving the ones you already love. This ensures that everyone enjoys a great experience with the app.

But your impact goes even further! Your support enables us to think bigger and create exciting new features to make Organized even more helpful for everyone, now and in the future.

## A donation from one user can help dozens of others

By donating, you’re ensuring that Organized continues to improve for congregations around the world. Your contribution not only allows us to maintain the app, but also expand its reach to assist congregations in remote areas and those with special needs.

Yes, **Organized will always be free** — no subscriptions, no fees. But with your donation, we can do even more! Your contribution allows us to not only focus on core features but also develop features to support congregations in remote areas, those who speak less common languages, and those with only a few brothers and meet the unique needs of our worldwide brotherhood.

## How to donate?

You can donate directly on [our Buy me a coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sws2apps/). Every donation, regardless of its size, is highly appreciated and makes a significant difference! If you'd like to donate, please choose an amount that you're comfortable with and proceed with either a one-time or monthly donation.

Your generous support will help us continue providing tools and apps to assist congregations worldwide. Thank you for considering a donation as your valuable contribution!
