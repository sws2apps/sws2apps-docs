# App's features

## Does the app include official form templates?

Yes, it does! Organized allows you to export schedules, reports, assignment forms, and more to printed PDF templates. These templates can be official ones, such as S-13, S-140, and S-89, S-21, S-99, or templates custom-designed by our team. With just a few clicks, you can provide necessary forms, such as those required by a circuit overseer. This feature is also useful if you prefer to use printed official forms in your congregation.

## Does Organized have an auto-assign feature?

Yes, Organized offers an auto-assign feature called "Autofill" that allows you to schedule parts of a meeting automatically based on the publisher's previous assignments history and qualifications. After using Autofill, you can still manually edit or create assignments as needed.

This feature can save you a significant amount of time, but it's not mandatory to use it. If you prefer manual scheduling, Organized still supports this process while providing easy access to past assignments history and warnings for publishers who already have assignments for the week. Organized lets you choose your preferred scheduling method and offers helpful features to make the process easier.

## Do I have to manually copy and paste info from the meeting workbook?

No, you don't have to! Organized can automatically fetch all meeting parts, public talks, and other necessary information directly from jw.org or an .epub file. This ensures that you always have the latest meeting program parts ready for assignment, without having to spend hours copying and pasting the meeting parts and then manually calculating their duration. This feature can save you a significant amount of time and effort, allowing you to focus on other important aspects of your congregation's meetings.

## Can I export print templates of the schedules?

Sure thing! Organized helps you efficiently manage schedules and other activities, providing the added convenience of easily exporting them into attractive print-ready files. Print them for your information board or share them as PDFs with others. Our top-quality PDF templates are created by a team of designers and have many variations and include all the important and additional information.

## What about Meeting Assignment Form?

Organized has you covered! In addition to easily exporting the midweek meeting schedule, the app also allows you to export all the student assignments in the S-89 form with just one click. You can then print them or share them digitally, whichever you prefer. This feature can save time and effort for appointed brothers and their assistants who typically fill out these forms and give them to students. With Organized, these brothers can focus more on supporting publishers and less on routine copy-paste tasks.

## Can I import a congregation data from another apps?

In our roadmap, we have the import feature that will allow you to import most of your congregation data from a few specific popular apps. In the meantime, you can manually enter your congregation data into Organized. Stay updated!

## Does the app have a dark theme?

Yes, it does! Organized offers both light and dark themes, so you can choose the one that suits your preference or leave it in auto mode to follow your device's system theme settings. Plus, the app has four different color schemes to choose from, so you can customize the look and feel to your liking.

## What features does Organized offer for pioneers?

Organized is a helpful app for pioneers to track their ministry time, Bible studies, and territory management. It allows you to submit service reports and view your monthly and annual statistics. Organized is a valuable tool that's always accessible, no matter what device you're using. Whether you're serving in the territory with your smartphone, participating in Zoom ministry on your computer or tablet, or using Time tracker feature in areas with no Internet connection else, Organized is there to help you!

## Does Organized send timely notificaitons?

Yes, Organized sends timely notifications to help you stay on top of your upcoming assignments and congregation activities. You'll receive reminders about your assignments, reports, as well as notifications about important events. As we continue to add new features to the app, you can expect to receive notifications about territories, important announcements, preaching partner requests, and more. With Organized, you'll always be up-to-date and informed about what's happening in your congregation.
