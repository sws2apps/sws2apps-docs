# General questions

## Is Organized free?

Yes, the Organized app is absolutely free and we want to keep it free forever. We don't ask for a monthly or annual subscription. We cover the server and maintenance costs ourselves.

Hovewer, if you enjoy using the app and find it beneficial, and if you feel inspired to contribute, your donation will be warmly welcomed and appreciated. While Organized will always remain free, your support will still make a big difference! With your [donation](../how-to-support/donate), we can not only focus on essential features but also go the extra mile to assist congregations located far away, those who speak rarely used languages, and those who have very few brothers. Together, we can expand our reach and provide valuable resources to those who need them most!

## Where can I find the Organized app?

Organized is a modern PWA app, meaining it operates in your device's browser (while not being web/cloud-based). Simply visit the [organized-app.com](https://organized-app.com) link, and you will open the app right away.

To try out Organized without registering, simply open the [test environment](test.organized-app.com), which comes pre-filled with dummy congregation data. This allows you to explore the app and its features without entering any user or congregation details. It's a quick and convenient way to familiarize yourself with the app right away, and it makes it easy to showcase its functionality to elders or friends before even registering your congregation.

## Can I download or install the app?

Yes, you can download and install the Organized PWA app on your device. As a Progressive Web App, Organized can be installed directly from your web browser without the need to go through an app store. This allows you to access the app quickly and easily, without taking up much storage space on your device.

To [install the app](../app-overview/open-and-install), simply navigate to the Organized website in your mobile browser, open the "More" menu. After clicking **"Install"** or **"Share"** button and then click **"Install"** or **"Add to the home screen"**, follow the prompts to add the app to your home screen. Once installed, you can access the app at any time, even without an internet connection.

## Can I download the Organized app from the Play Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, or other app stores?

Since Organized utilizes modern PWA technology, downloading it through traditional app stores is not a must. Currently, the app is not available in any app stores. Instead, you can easily set it up as a Progressive Web App (PWA) by following the instructions provided in the paragraph above.

However, we are actively working on a solution to publish the app in popular app stores using native wrapper apps. These wrappers will offer a native app on each platform while maintaining a unified codebase, enabling faster development and reducing maintenance costs. This approach will also make it easier for users to discover and download the app in a familiar way.

## Is Organized available as a mobile app? Or is it computer-only?

Organized is a web app, which means that you can access it from any device. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA), which offers the convenience and functionality of a native app on both computer and mobile devices.

## Organized is PWA. What does it mean?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of website that works like a native app but runs in your web browser. It provides a fast and reliable experience, can work offline, and even send you notifications. You can either use it on any device with a modern web browser, just like a regular website, or click “Install” button to add the app to your home page and get better experience.

## Is Organized a web/cloud-based, or native app?

Organized isn’t a cloud-based or fully online app, but it’s not a traditional native app either. While you can access it through a web browser, it is designed to work locally on your device. When you register and open the app for the first time, it automatically downloads and caches all necessary data on your device. After that, most interactions, such as managing tasks and schedules, are performed directly on your device, allowing you to use it even offline.

This approach provides significant benefits in terms of security and convenience. Since your data is stored locally, you maintain full control over it. Additionally, because Organized isn't internet-dependent, you can continue to use it without needing a constant connection – ideal for managing congregation tasks wherever you are.

## What operating systems are supported?

All modern systems are supported – Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, ChromeOS, and Linux. Organized is a progressive web app (PWA) that operates seamlessly with a modern browser, making it accessible on any device without the need for separate mobile or desktop apps. This means that you always have access to the full power and functionality of the app, whether you're using a smartphone, tablet, or computer. Enjoy this flexibility of using your account on multiple desktop or mobile devices simultaneously!

## What languages are available in Organized?

Currently, Organized supports around 30 languages, either fully and partially. TThis includes widely spoken languages in our theocratic world such as English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, French, and Japanese. Additionally, the app already supports many other languages like Polish, Ukrainian, Malagasy, Russian, Romanian, and more.

## How reliable is Organized's uptime, and what features are affected during outages?

The uptime of Organized is largely reliable because most app functions operate locally on your device. This design helps maintain close to 100% uptime, as the app relies on a local database rather than solely on cloud connectivity. Even during brief periods of downtime, key features such as meeting scheduling, PDF exporting, ministry timers, and data imports from jw.org remain fully functional.

When online functionality is in use, we ensure that the app is always available, and any downtimes will be promptly communicated to users through in-app notifications. In the event that server-side maintenance temporarily affects certain features, users will be informed right away. The only functionalities that may be impacted during short outages include:

- **Data sync:** Data synchronization occurs every 5 minutes. If a connection is lost, any entered data will automatically sync once the connection is restored, ensuring no information is lost.

- **Login and registration:** Users will not be logged out automatically; however, those attempting to log in during an outage may need to wait a few minutes to access their accounts.

- **Collaborative features:** Features requiring real-time data sharing—like sending reports to the secretary or syncing public talk speakers—will not be accessible in offline mode. Normally, these features are rarely used, so their temporary unavailability will have minimal impact on the overall user experience.

In summary, even during downtime, most features remain accessible without interruption, and no data will be lost. The app is designed to provide functionality at all times, even offline. During short outages, only a few rarely used features may be affected, and these issues are quickly resolved, resulting in a user experience where most individuals will hardly notice any disruption in real-world scenarios. Once connectivity is restored, everything will sync seamlessly for you to continue enjoying the full functionality.
