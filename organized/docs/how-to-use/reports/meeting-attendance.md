# Meeting attendance record

In Organized, you simply have to timely enter all the data into the app for you to get all the reports and statistics later when you need it (e.g. for a circuit overseer visit or submitting reports to the branch office). The Meeting attendance record page is no exception â€“ simply enter the people count during each meeting, and Organized will automatically save it and instantly include it into the general statistics and report. Let's see what helpful features and settings you have here on this page.
