# Meeting attendance record

In Organized, you simply have to timely enter all the data into the app for you to get all the reports and statistic later when you need it (e.g. for a circuit overseer visit or submitting reports to the branch office). Meeting attendance record page is no exception â€“ simply enter the people count during each meeting, and Organized will automatically save it and instantly include it into the general statistic and report. Let's see what helpful features and setting do you have here on this page.
