# Midweek meeting

If you have the corresponding user role and rights to edit midweek meeting schedule, you will see this Midweek meeting button on your home dashboard page. Click on it and you'll land on the page where you have everything to schedule your congregation's midweek meetings with ease.

Let's learn more about all the possibilities of the app, to make sure you're using the full potential of Organized!

## Navigation

The page structure is quite simple, but contains many powerful tools. 

* On the top of the page you see key action buttons related to the midweek meeting page: Publish, Autofill, and Export. We will dive deeper into each of them later in this article.
* On the left-hand side there is a list of meeting weeks. You can browse between different months and even years from there.
* On the right-hand side is located the main scheduling card, where the whole meeting schedule is awaiting for filling it out with assingees. 

Does the structure looks clear? Let's move on then to the scheduling itself.

## Step 1: The most important

Import from jw.org (or alternatively you can use import from .epub file) to get all the meeting program, including weekly Bible reading text, songs, meeting part titles, duration, source materials and everything you need to start scheduling. Thanks to this automatic import from jw.org website you won't need to do manual duration calculation or repetetive copy-paste actions to get the program parts titles right.

:::tip[Import from jw.org]
Even though the import from jw.org is performed automatically, once every few weeks to ensure that you always have the newest meeting materials and ready to scheduling, please be aware that this automatic import is not instantly performed right after each small update from jw.org. So if you want to be 100% sure that you got the latest version of the schedule, click the 'Import from jw.org' action button on the home page dashboard before starting creating a new schedule. This takes only five extra seconds, but removed any uncertainty from your mind.

## Step 2: Start scheduling

### Select week

Select a week from the 'Meeting weeks' list. It contains all 12 month for each year, and by expanding any of them, you will access a list of weeks for each month. From there it's also easy to track the scheduling progress by seeing the progress bar and the number of assignments scheduled vs total assignments count for this particular week.

### Select week type

Most of the year, the week type is just 'Normal week'. But there are some presets for you to make better schedules:

* Visit of circuit overseer
* Week of Circuit Assembly
* Week of Regional Convention
* Week of Memorial
* No meeting

When there's no meeting this week, instead of leaving all fields empty for a meeting and moving on to the next one, use one of these presets. Selecting one of them, will add extra indicators to the schedules both in the app and on the print, to notify publishers in your congregation. You can even optionally leave a message that will be displayed on the schedules for date when there's no meeting, to specify some context, or for example assembly/convention name, date and place which will also be beneficial for brothers and sisters.

### Assign automatically with Autofill feature

### Assign manually

### View publisher's assignment history

When you are unsure about a specific assignment for a specific student or brother, you can view their past history of assignments to have more context of the type of their past assignments, its exact date, what partner did they have, and even in which hall it was given. This comprehensive information can help you to make more balanced solutions that are better for students, and it's very easy to view all the history at a glance.

### Two edit modes

The editing mode switch at the top of the scheduling card allows to keep the page layout clean, because most of the time your will need to edit only the assignments. But once in a while when you need to edit the meeting part, Organized provides this additional functionality as well. Let's see what each one does: 

* **Edit assignments:** Standard mode. Allows to view-only the meeting parts on the left, and assign the brothers and students on the right.
* **Edit parts: name**, Optional mode for cases when there are changes in the meeting program. You can edit certain program parts that may change, or overwrite some parts with your custom data (useful when a meeting part should be replaced with a Governing Body Update for example), or even add a custom meeting part.

:::warning[Please, note]

You **cannot edit both assignments and meeting parts at the same time**. Therefore there's a switch to make the scheduling experience less overwhelmed and more pleasant. This means that if you selected the 'Edit parts' mode and then want to edit the assignments, then you need to select back the 'Edit assignment' mode first.

:::

### Delete multiple assignments

If you were just testing how the page work, or did a couple of mistakes, instead of removing assignments one-by-one, you can use the 'Delete multiple assignments' button. It's located under the month list in the 'Meeting weeks' card.

After clicking, you will see a window asking the date range you would like to clear. This can be one week or even multiple months. Once the date range is selected, click the 'Clear selected weeks' button. All the assignments within that range will be cleared and ready for re-scheduling. **Note, that the meeting parts (titles, duration, etc) won't be deleted, this features clears assignments only.**

## Step 3: Publish the schedules

Publish for everyone in the Organized to view the schedules and see their upcoming assignments.

:::danger

Without publishing the schedule, nobody using Organized app won't see the new schedule you've just created. **Don't forget to publish schedules** every time you finished working on them and want to make it available for others in your congregation.

## Step 4: Export for print

Now, let's save the meeting schedule and student assignment forms to put them onto the information board and also handover the assignment forms to students personally. This ensures that everyone in your congregation has easy access to the newly created schedule, not only in Organized, but also in your Kingdom Hall ðŸ™‚ Export feature works fast and reliable even without Internet connection.

### Export meeting schedule (S-140)

Click the 'Export' button at the top of the page. Select the desired month range for exporting and then select the **Midweek meeting schedule (S-140)** option. Hit 'Export' and in a few seconds your schedule in print-ready PDF format will be downloaded to your device. It's that easy and quick! 

### Export meeting assignment form (S-89)

Also click the 'Export' button at the top of the page and select the desired month range. This time select **Assignment form (S-89)** option. Then you have two options:

* **Print-ready version (4 assignments per page):** Each page of the PDF document will be A4 paper size and contain 4 different assignments, making it easy to print, cut and handover multiple assignment forms at once.
* **Each assignment as a separate PDF file:** Each page of the PDF document will be the original assignment form size, one assignment per page. This is useful when you prefer to send out assignments only digitally (for instance, you could take screenshots of each individual assignment or convert it to the set of images and send it to each student through Telegram, WhatsApp, E-mail or another communication app).
