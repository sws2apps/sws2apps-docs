# My assignments

My assignments ‚Äì is one of the most-used features of the Organized app. It's used by everyone in a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, who takes part in our weekly meetings. Here you can view all your upcoming assignments, whether it's a student assignment, public talk, Kingdom Hall cleaning, or meeting duties.

## Open 'My assignments' panel

There are multiple ways to open this panel, ensuring you can quickly and easily access this important information in Organized:

1. **'Meetings' card**. There's a dedicated 'My assignments' button which also has an assignments count badge for you to know the exact number.

## Set a time range to display

If you have many upcoming assignments, you can use the 'Display' setting to select how many months you want to display on this sidebar. You can choose to display assignments for the next 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months.

## View your upcoming assignments

All assignments are displayed in chronological month-by-month order. Each assignment row contains the following information:

- **'Delivered by'**: This orange badge indicates assignments of congregation persons that have been delegated to you (meaning you can view their assignments and notify delegated persons about the upcoming assignments). It displays the name of the person who has the assignment, along with all the necessary details.
