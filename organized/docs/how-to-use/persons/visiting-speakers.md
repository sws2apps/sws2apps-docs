# Visiting speakers

The Visiting Speakers feature is an invaluable tool for your congregation if you serve as public talk coordinator. It promotes collaboration, offers a greater variety of speakers, and helps distribute the workload among your local speakers. This guide will walk you through how to use this feature effectively.

The page is divided into to sections: Your congregation and Other congregations. Let's see how to set up everything and make the best use of it.

## Your congregation

That the place where you have your outgoing speakers list, their talks, and some additional useful settings. You can expand and collapse this card depending on your current focus. Inside of this Your congregation card you can see:

### Congregation name and number

Your congregation's name and ID are automatically filled in from the Organized congregation registration information. This helps maintain consistency and ensures that other congregations can identify and connect with each other easily.

### Congregation visibility in the congregation search in Organized

Toggle this option to make your congregation discoverable to others when they're looking for outgoing speakers. When enabled, other congregations can search for yours by name or number and send a request to access your speakers list. This list will only be visible to them after you manually accept their request.

Please note that even if your congregation is discoverable in Organized, there is no global list of all discoverable congregations. For another congregation to request your outgoing speakers list, they must enter your congregation's name or number in the search. If your congregation is set to be discoverable, it will appear in their search results; if not, no results will be shown, even if they enter your congregation's complete name.

This means **you always have the full control** over sharing your outgoing speakers list, with a two-stage process ensuring that access is granted only to those you approve.

### Your outgoing speakers list

If your congregation has approved outgoing speakers and you want to improve public talk scheduling collaboration between your local congregations, fill out your outgoing speakers list in Organized. This is useful to have the list filled out even if you don't plan to collaborate with other congregations directly through the app, because on this page you will be able to quickly access the important information and keep in up-to-date even for your personal use as a public talk coordinator. But if you turn on the congregation discoverability toggle, this will enable even better digital collaboration between congregations that are already using Organized.

Let's see how you can create your congregation's outgoing speakers list and update is to always have the correct information.

#### Add outgoing speakers

Click the 'Edit' pencil icon at the top right corner of Your congregation card. Once entered the edit mode, you're able to add new speakers and edit or delete existing ones. Simply click 'Add speaker' button, and then select a speaker from the dropdown list and afterwards, select the specific talks that he's allowed to deliver in other congregations, one by one. Keep in mind, that you don't have to manually enter the speaker names here. All you have to do is to select brothers that already have the public talk [assignment qualification](add-person#assignments) on their Persons page. So if you can't see a brother in the speakers list, please make sure he has everything correctly set up in his person record.

Organized' goal is to always simplify your workflow, therefore the app allows not only to add public talks titles/numbers, but also songs that certain speaker has chosen for each talk! After adding public talks, each time you will be asked to add songs to this talk, so simply enter one or more songs to save them. **Having more then one song is always benefitial** for cases when Watchtower study song is the same as provided by a speaker. 

:::tip[But wait, isn't it additional work to collect all the songs?]
Adding songs in advance (of course, after requesting one more songs from a speaker) opens even more possibilities for better meeting scheduling! For example, Organized will be able to easily insert the song into the weekend meeting schedule, bringing more peace of mind for the speaker himself, as well as meeting conductor and of course for the audio/video team. Organized app will even warn the weekend meeting overseer when a song selected by a speaker conflicts with a song in the existing meeting program, ensuring no duplicated songs during the same meeting. So even though creating a song list requires some extra effort at the beginning, by doing so you're showing your brotherly love and care for many other brothers involved into scheduling and meeting conduction.

To view or edit the songs list for each speaker simply click the 'Songs' button. In this window you will see more details about the speaker, including two tabs:
- **Talks and songs**: All the talks and their corresponding songs. Edit the songs list by clicking the 'Edit songs' button. After you add or remove certain songs, click 'Done' to finish editing.
- **Contact info:** View phone number(s) or email address(es) of the selected speaker. By clicking on the number or email you're able to directly contact the speaker without copying data manually.

After you're done adding all the nesessary information about your outgoing speakers, hit the 'Done' checkmark icon at the top right corner. Right after this you will see a quick overview of all your congregation's speakers and their talks.

#### Edit outgoing speakers

Editing the speakers and their talks in Organized is as easy as adding them. Click the 'Edit' pencil at the top right corner, do the nesessary changes to speakers, their talks, songs, add or delete the speakers by using corresponding buttons, and then click the 'Done' checkmark icon at the top right corner.
