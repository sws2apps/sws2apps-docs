If you want to serve as an auxiliary pioneer continuously, meaning not just one or more months, but until your further notice, then you can only select 30 hours goal. If you've selected 15 hours goal and then select the __"I desire to serve continuously as an auxiliary pioneer until further notice"__ checkbox, the hours goal will be automatically set to 30.
