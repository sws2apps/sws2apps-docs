# Invite persons to your congregation

To invite persons to your congregation on Organized, follow these steps based on their user type. There are two global user types: "Baptised brother" and "Publisher or midweek student".

- **"Baptised brother"** is any baptized brother. We create an account for any baptized brother specifically, so that his profile is already in the right user group once he is appointed to a ministerial servant or other assistant role.

- **"Publisher or midweek student"** is any other member of the congregation, including baptized sisters, unbaptized brothers or sisters, or male or female students on a midweek meeting.

Click "Add new user" button on the "Manage access to Organized" page. Then, follow the steps below based on the user type you want to invite.

## Baptized brother

To add a baptized brother to your congregation, he should already have an account registered in Organized. Once he has registered, you can search for his account by email address and add his to your congregation.

1. Select the corresponding **"Baptized brother"** option.
2. Ask a baptized brother for the email address he used to register in Organized.

3. Use this email to add him to your congregation.

:::tip[If you see "No user found with this email address":]
Make sure that you enter the correct email address with no typos and that the brother has indeed created an Organized account and he sees "Thanks for registering" message on Organized app

4. Once you enter a correct email address that already exists on Organized, the email field will be highlighted with green saying _"User found! Create user and set up his profile and rights"_.

5. Click "Create user" button and then his user record will be added.

## Publisher or midweek student

To bind a user profile with a person record from your congregation, ensure that you have already added this brother or sister to the congregation's [Persons page](/organized/docs/how-to-use/persons/all-persons.md).

1. Select the corresponding **"Publisher or midweek student"** option.
2. Select a person record from the list. Make sure that the person record already exists on the [Persons page](/organized/docs/how-to-use/persons/all-persons.md) so that you can find it.

![Publisher option](./img/publisher-start.png)

3. After you selected the person from the list, simply click "Create user" button.
4. Right after that, you will see the "Invite user" window with their personal unique invitation code. Provide this personal invitation code to grant them access to your congregation on Organized.

:::tip[The invitation code will always be accessible] 
Note, that this code will also be available on their user page, so no need to worry that it will disappear after you close this window. You can always access it later.
:::

5. Copy the code and give this code to the user in a secure way. You can manually copy it, or use "Copy" or "Share" button to share it faster. 
6. After clicking "Done", the new user record will be added.

## Well done!
