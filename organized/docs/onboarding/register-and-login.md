# Register and join congregation

Once you open the [Organized app](https://organized-app.com/), you need to log in to your account. If you don’t have an account yet – registration process is identical to the sign-in process. When you follow the steps below, your account will be automatically created. 

:::tip[There are two ways to log in to the Organized app:]
1. As a **publisher or a midweek student**.
2. As a **baptized brother**.
:::

Here you need to select an option that suits your main current congregation role.

- Baptized brothers, that don’t have any responsibilities yet (but might have in the future), 
- Baptized brothers, that have responsibilities (e.g., help with territories, filling out forms, etc.),
- Ministerial servants,
- Elders.
