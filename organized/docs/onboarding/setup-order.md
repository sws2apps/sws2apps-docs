# Recommended congregation setup steps order

Here's the recommended order for setting up your newly created congregation in Organized. Following this sequence ensures a smooth and consistent setup experience, where each step prepares the necessary data for the next.

Each step below includes direct links to the corresponding user guide articles, so feel free to click through for more detailed instructions.

## Recommended steps
 
1. **Register your congregation**. Start from the [registering your own account](../onboarding/register-and-login) and then [create your congregation](../onboarding/create-congregation) in Organized.
2. **Configure congregation settings**: Set up your congregation and meeting details, security settings, and time/date/name format preferences on the [Congregation settings](../how-to-use/congregation/congregation-settings) page. Explore different parameters available there.
3. **[Create field service groups](../how-to-use/congregation/field-service-groups)**: Set up all the field service groups in your congregation, which will allow you to add publishers to the correct groups later.
4. **[Add congregation persons](../how-to-use/persons/add-person)**: Enter details like contact information, field service group assignments, qualifications, spiritual status, enrollments, and other necessary data.
5. **Add users to the app**: [Add/invite users to the Organized app](../how-to-use/congregation/invite-persons) via the 'User accounts' page, ensuring they have the appropriate roles and permissions.
6. **[Set up speaker catalog](../how-to-use/persons/visiting-speakers)**: Add your local and outgoing speakers, as well as visiting speakers from other congregations, to simplify and streamline the scheduling of public talks.
7. **Import meeting materials**: Preferably [import directly from jw.org](../how-to-use/meeting-materials/import-jw-org) for the latest workbooks, Watchtower articles, and more. Alternatively, [import from a pre-downloaded .EPUB file](../how-to-use/meeting-materials/import-epub) if you lack an internet connection or if the jw.org import feature is temporarily unavailable.
8. **Start using Organized**: Start scheduling meetings, public talks, and recording important data to generate and submit congregation and ministry reports. You can also add publishers' previous reports for a complete and accurate report of the service year.
