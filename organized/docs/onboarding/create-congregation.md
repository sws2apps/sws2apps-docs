Please, ensure elders of your congregation approve Organized app usage before proceeding.

### Set up an encryption code.

This code safeguards your congregation's info. This code should be strong, but without too tricky symbols. Remember that publishers should be able to enter this code on their devices as well. Please, avoid using widely known or obvious numbers and words like _1914_, or _Organized_. 

:::danger[Encryption code is very important]
If you lose this code, you'll need to start all over again, **all congregation data will be lost**. Note it and keep it safe! Notify brothers and sisters to not share it with others. Keeping your congregation info secure is a joint goal and responsibility of all users.

### Your congregation is created!

Done! Once set up, you will land on your congregation's page as the admin. From here, you can add members, assign roles like coordinator or secretary, and grant specific rights, such as editing schedules and others. Explore other guide articles to learn how to do that.
