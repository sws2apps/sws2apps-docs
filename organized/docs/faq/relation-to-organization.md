# Is app related to Jehovah's Witnesses organization?

## Is Organized an official application from Jehovah's Witnesses organization?

No, the app is not made by Jehovah’s Witnesses organization. Our small development team consists of enthusiastic brothers and sisters from a few countries who donate their time to maintain the app and create new features. Most of our team members are pioneers, ministerial servants and elders.

## Is the Organized app approved by Bethel or World Headquarters?

Our software is not mandatory to use, but it complies with all up-to-date Governing Body directions. Bethel doesn't create a list of approved or forbidden software, similar to the principle outlined in our organization's stance on entertainment choices: "[Our organization doesn’t review specific movies, books, or songs so as to rule on what individuals should avoid](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/do-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-certain-entertainment/)".

The usage of unofficial theocratic apps developed by Jehovah's Witnesses for Jehovah's Witnesses is subject to the choice of the body of elders of each congregation, considering local circumstances and organizational guidelines. Therefore, since there is no such thing as an "official list of theocratic apps approved by Bethel," the Organized app is unlikely to be officially authorized by the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Using Organized is not forbidden. We always make sure to align the application, its security, and use cases with all the latest directions from the Faithful and Discreet Slave. Moreover, many publishers serving both onsite and remotely for different Bethels worldwide are directly involved in the development of the Organized application.

## Is Bethel aware of Organized app?

Firstly, there are many Bethel branches worldwide. We have spoken to many brothers from various Bethel branches globally, therefore many Bethel workers are aware of Organized. In fact, some of them are even assisting us with development, translation, and advices. However, please do not expect any Bethel branch to officially recommend or authorize Organized, as it is not an official tool from the Jehovah's Witnesses organization. Ultimately, the choice of using such tools is something that each body of elders should decide for their congregation.
