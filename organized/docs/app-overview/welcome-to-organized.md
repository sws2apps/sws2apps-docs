# Welcome to Organized!

[Organized](https://organized-app.com/) is a free progressive web application crafted specifically for Jehovah's Witnesses congregations. Developed by our team at Scheduling Workbox System, it's designed for ease of use by every member of the congregation. Watch our [introductory video to the Organized app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czQB-LEfqg) on YouTube or visit [About Organized](https://about.organized-app.com) website to get a quick overview. We are actively developing the app to bring more features and to make it more and more useful for every person in a congregation.

## What are the benefits of using the Organized app?

When it comes to benefits in real-life situations, consider the following: Reduced stress for every congregation member, hundreds of hours saved for appointed brothers, streamlined digital processes with way less waste, improved speed of collaboration, and enhanced convenience for all.

To explore the Organized concept, features, and its benefits in a more visual format, feel free to visit our [About Organized](https://about.organized-app.com) webpage — an ideal resource to introduce Organized to others, or view video tutorials on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@organized-app).

## How Organized is different compared to other theocratic apps?

We know that there are other apps aiming to support congregations. We're not trying to judge which app is the best. Simply try Organized to see if it's a good fit for you.

Some of the Organized differentiators are:

1.  **Free for everyone,**
2.  **Open-source code with full transparency,**
3.  **User-centered and design-first approach,**
4.  **Easy and convenient to use,**
5.  **Cross-platform flexibility,**
6.  **An active team dedicated to constantly improving the app.**

## Is Organized an official application from the organization?

No, it is not an official app from the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Our team consists of volunteer brothers and sisters who serve in different countries. Organized offers beneficial features for congregations, but its use is your choice. We recommend speaking with your congregation elders before starting to use the app for the whole congregation.

## Why is Organized a web application? Is it safe to use in a congregation?

We believe that moving from desktop to web applications offers many advantages and greater flexibility for congregations, while maintaining top-level security. With a web application, you can access your data from any device with a browser—whether you're using Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, or mobile devices like Android, iPadOS, iOS, or even less popular systems like SailfishOS and HarmonyOS. This makes working across platforms seamless and more convenient.

We understand the security challenges that come with web applications, and we've taken all necessary steps to keep your data safe. Our app is built using cutting-edge security technologies, and we're continuously improving it to stay ahead of any challenges and comply with main data protection regulations like GDPR in Europe. To ensure that only your congregation members can access sensitive data, we've implemented several security features, including local storage, end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and an app lock feature. With these measures in place, you can be confident that your congregation's data remains confidential and protected at all times. To learn more about our Organized's security and GDPR compliance, see the [FAQ – Security](../faq/security.md) page.
