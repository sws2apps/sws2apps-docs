# Welcome to Organized!

[Organized](https://organized-app.com/) is a free progressive web application crafted specifically for Jehovah's Witnesses congregations. Developed by our team at Scheduling Workbox System, it's designed for ease of use by every member of the congregation. Watch our [introductory video to the Organized app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czQB-LEfqg) on YouTube or visit [About Organized](https://about.organized-app.com) website to get a quick overview. We are actively developing the app to bring more features and to make it more and more useful for every person in a congregation.

## How Organized is different compared to other theocratic apps?

We know that there are other apps aiming to support congregations. We're not trying to judge which app is the best. Simply try Organized to see if it's a good fit for you.

Some of the Organized differentiators are:

1.  **Free for everyone,**
2.  **Open-source code with full transparency,**
3.  **User-centered and design-first approach,**
4.  **Easy and convenient to use,**
5.  **Cross-platform flexibility,**
6.  **An active team dedicated to constantly improving the app.**

## Is Organized an official application from the organization?

No, it is not an official app from the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Our team consists of volunteer brothers and sisters who serve in different countries. Organized offers beneficial features for congregations, but its use is your choice. We recommend speaking with your congregation elders before starting to use the app for the whole congregation.

## Why is Organized a web application? Is it safe to use in a congregation?

We believe that transitioning from desktop applications to web applications offers many advantages and greater flexibility, while still maintaining a high level of security. With web applications, you can access your data from any device with a browser, regardless of the platform or operating system. This means you can work seamlessly across Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, and mobile devices running Android, iPadOS, or iOS.

We understand the security challenges of web applications, and we've taken every step to ensure that your data is safe and secure. Our app is built using the latest and most advanced security technologies, and we're constantly working to enhance its security and keep up with the latest developments in web technologies.

To ensure that only members of your congregation can access your data, we've implemented a range of special security measures. These include local storage, end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and an app lock feature. With these measures in place, you can be confident that your data is strongly confidential and always protected.
