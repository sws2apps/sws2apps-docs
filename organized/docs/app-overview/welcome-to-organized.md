# Welcome to Organized!

[Organized](https://organized-app.com/) is a free application crafted specifically for Jehovah's Witnesses congregations. Developed by our team at Scheduling Workbox System, it's designed for ease of use by every member of the congregation. Watch our [introductory video to the Organized app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czQB-LEfqg) on YouTube or visit [About Organized](https://about.organized-app.com) website to get a quick overview. We are actively developing the app to bring more features and to make it more and more useful for every person in a congregation.

## How is Organized different from other theocratic apps?

Organized is built with the user in mind, designed to serve you without a learning curve, huge time or stress investments, or extra maintenance. Our approach is simple: we love what we do, work with talented developers and designers to build the best user experience, and aim to share what we’ve created to make things easier and more... *organized* for other Jehovah’s Witnesses.

We know there are other apps for congregations, and we’re not here to say which one is best — that’s for you to decide. Just try Organized and see if it’s the right fit for you!

Some of the Organized differentiators to consider are:

1.  **Free for everyone, forever**
2.  **Open-source and fully transparent,**
3.  **User-centered design with a focus on simplicity,**
4.  **Quick, easy, and convenient to use,**
5.  **Works seamlessly across platforms,**
6.  **An active team committed to continuous improvements,**
7.  **Friendly, helpful support whenever you need it.**

## Is Organized an official application from the organization?

No, it is not an official app from the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Our team consists of volunteer brothers and sisters serving in different countries. Organized offers beneficial features for congregations, but its use is entirely your choice. While the app is not forbidden, we encourage you to speak with your congregation elders before using it in your congregation. We also strive to follow the most up-to-date guidelines and comply with data protection laws, including GDPR, to ensure your information is secure.

## Is Organized a web/cloud-based, or native app? Understanding its functionality

Organized is not a cloud-based app, nor is it a native application. It's another type of application called Progressive Web App (PWA). While you can access it through a web browser, it is designed to work locally on your device. When you register and open the app for the first time, it automatically downloads and caches all necessary data on your device. After that, most interactions, such as managing tasks and schedules, are performed directly on your device, allowing you to use it even offline.

This approach provides significant benefits in terms of security and convenience. Since your data is stored locally, you maintain full control over it. Additionally, because Organized isn't internet-dependent, you can continue to use it without needing a constant connection – ideal for managing congregation tasks wherever you are.

## Why is Organized a PWA application? Is it safe to use in a congregation?

We believe that moving from desktop to web applications offers many advantages and greater flexibility for congregations, while maintaining top-level security. With a web application, you can access your data from any device with a browser—whether you're using Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, or mobile devices like Android, iPadOS, iOS, or even less popular systems like SailfishOS and HarmonyOS. This makes working across platforms seamless and more convenient.

We understand the security challenges that come with web applications, and we've taken all necessary steps to keep your data safe. Our app is built using cutting-edge security technologies, and we're continuously improving it to stay ahead of any challenges and comply with main data protection regulations like GDPR in Europe. To ensure that only your congregation members can access sensitive data, we've implemented several security features, including local storage, end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and an app lock feature. With these measures in place, you can be confident that your congregation's data remains confidential and protected at all times. To learn more about our Organized's security and GDPR compliance, see the [FAQ – Security](../faq/security.md) page.
