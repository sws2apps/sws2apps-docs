# Help us translate

While Organized already supports many languages, we're always looking to expand to be available for as many brothers and sisters as possible. If you speak a language that's not yet represented in Organized, we'd be really glad if you could help with translations. You can contribute through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/organized), a user-friendly platform that makes the translation process easy and straightforward. Your translated text will be included in the next app release, helping Organized reach even more congregations around the world.

## How to start translating

The translation process is not complicated. Simply:
1. Create a Crowdin account, 
2. Open the Organized [translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/organized),
3. Start translating. 

For better understanding, please view our short [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG5q_NkfD6s) about the Organized translation process using Crowdin.

## My language is not yet on Crowdin

If you would like to add a language not yet available on Crowdin, please open [a new Issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=i18n&projects=&template=new_language_request.yml&title=%5BLanguage%5D+-+New+Language+Request) on our GitHub repository page, and we will add it as soon as possible. You will be asked to fill out some key translations for your language. By doing so, we can train an AI model to translate the entire application, allowing you to focus on proofreading rather than translating each string from scratch.
