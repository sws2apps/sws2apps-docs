# Spread the word – recommend Organized!

Sharing Organized with others in your congregation or in other congregations helps us all. When you tell others about the app, more people join in, making the app a better ecosystem for everyone in your congregation, then in your city, then in your circuit and so on. 

The Organized app helps publishers in a congregation and appointed brothers in many ways. It saves time for responsible brothers by handling tasks automatically and keeping everyone updated. Publishers get notifications on their assignments, making things less stressful. Plus, using the app means updates happen quickly and accurately. And by going digital, we also help reduce paper and ink use, which is good for the environment. 

## Why?

As more congregations use Organized, it becomes more helpful and improves the collaboration between appointed brothers and between congregations. So, by spreading the word, you're helping create a better and more helpful community for all of us.

## How?

### Option 1: Star the GitHub project
One of the easiest ways to show your support for the Organized app and help it gain more visibility is to star the [Organized repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app). To do this, click the star icon ⭐️ in the top right corner of the repository's main page. By starring the repository, you'll make it easier for other enthusiastic publishers and developers on GitHub to discover and contribute to the project. This small action can have a significant impact on the growth and improvement of the Organized app. 

### Option 2: Show the app to others
Why won't just show the app to somebody who might like it or someone who finds their current responsibility a bit challenging? To quickly and easily introduce the Organized app, we've created the [About Organized](https://about.organized-app.com) page – a great resource that you can share with others. This website provides an overview of the app and addresses some of the most frequently asked questions. By sharing this webpage, you can help others discover the benefits of using our app and understand its key features and functionality. We encourage you to share this page with anyone who might be interested in learning more about the Organized app.
