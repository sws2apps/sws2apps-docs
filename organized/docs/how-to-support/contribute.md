## Join our development team

Got skills in React, Javascript, Typescript, or Node.js? That's fantastic! We'd love for you to join our development team. With our organized approach and clear documentation, you can jump right in and start contributing. Since the Organized app is an open-source project, together, we can make the Organized app an even more powerful tool for our global brotherhood.

For more detailed information, please see [Organized GitHub repository](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app), [development contribution guide](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [local environment setup tutorial](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/blob/main/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md).

## Share your design ideas

Are you a UI/UX designer who works in Figma? We'd love to hear from you! Your insights can help shape new features or refine existing ones, making the user experience even better. If you have suggestions or ideas, or just open for occasional collaboration, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to create designs and features that everyone will love to use!

If you have any ideas in mind â€“ feel free to create some sketches or wireframes in Figma and share with us, by suggesting them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/discussions) page.

## Let's make more video tutorials

If you're proficient in motion design and video editing, we can collaborate to create more visual video tutorials for Organized [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@organized-app). Depending on your availability and skills, you can work on either longer-format videos or on Shorts (up to 60s) that demonstrate one feature at a time. We already have numerous features we want to share, so your assistance will be greatly appreciated!
