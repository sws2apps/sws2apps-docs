# Contribution opportunities

Are you wondering how you can use your time and skills to support the growth of Organized? We've put together some ways you can help out. 

Whether you're sharing Organized with others, joining our development efforts, offering design insights, or assisting in translations, each effort helps. Your support truly makes a difference!

## Join our development team

Got skills in React, Javascript, Typescript, or Node.js? That's fantastic! We'd love for you to join our development team. With our organized approach and clear documentation, you can jump right in and start contributing. Since the Organized app is an open-source project, together, we can make the Organized app an even more powerful tool for our global brotherhood.

For more detailed information, please see [Organized GitHub repository](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app), [development contribution guide](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [local environment setup tutorial](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/blob/main/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md).

## Share your UI/UX design vision and ideas

Are you a UI/UX designer who works in Figma? We'd love to hear from you! Your insights can help shape new features or refine existing ones, making the user experience even better. If you have suggestions or ideas, or just open for collaboration, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to create designs and features that everyone will love to use!

If you have any ideas in mind â€“ feel free to create some sketches or wireframes in Figma and share with us, by suggesting them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/discussions) page.

## Graphic design contributions for Organized

Occasionally, we need images, illustrations, YouTube thumbnails, and other graphics for our apps, website, and announcements. If you have good graphic design skills and are open for collaboration, we invite you to contribute by creating visually appealing banners and other images for web usage. Your skills and volunteer spirit will help enhance the visual experience of the Organized ecosystem.

## Let's make more video tutorials

If you're proficient in motion design and video editing, we can collaborate to create more visual video tutorials for Organized [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@organized-app). Depending on your availability and skills, you can work on either longer-format videos or on Shorts (up to 60s) that demonstrate one feature at a time. We already have numerous features we want to share, so your assistance will be greatly appreciated!

## Help us to write such articles

This "How to use" guide is continually updated, with new articles added after new feature releases or updates. We have a [separate repository for the guide](https://github.com/sws2apps/sws2apps-docs) with the app articles inside, so it's easy to collaborate. If you're fluent in English and would like to assist with writing articles as your time allows, please propose your help below. By doing so, our development team can focus more on development and deliver new Organized versions and features faster! Your contribution is greatly appreciated!
