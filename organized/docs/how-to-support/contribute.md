# Contribution opportunities

Are you wondering how you can use your time and skills to support the growth of Organized? We've put together some ways you can help out. 

Whether you're sharing Organized with others, joining our development efforts, offering design insights, or assisting in translations, each effort helps. Your support truly makes a difference!

## Join our development team

Got skills in React, Javascript, Typescript, or Node.js? That's fantastic! We'd love for you to join our development team. With our organized approach and clear documentation, you can jump right in and start contributing. Since the Organized app is an open-source project, together, we can make the Organized app an even more powerful tool for our global brotherhood.

For more detailed information, please see [Organized GitHub repository](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app), [development contribution guide](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [local environment setup tutorial](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/blob/main/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md).

## Share your design ideas

Are you a UI/UX designer who works in Figma? We'd love to hear from you! Your insights can help shape new features or refine existing ones, making the user experience even better. If you have suggestions or ideas, or just open for occasional collaboration, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to create designs and features that everyone will love to use!

If you have any ideas in mind â€“ feel free to create some sketches or wireframes in Figma and share with us, by suggesting them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/discussions) page.

## Let's make more video tutorials

If you're proficient in motion design and video editing, we can collaborate to create more visual video tutorials for Organized [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@organized-app). Depending on your availability and skills, you can work on either longer-format videos or on Shorts (up to 60s) that demonstrate one feature at a time. We already have numerous features we want to share, so your assistance will be greatly appreciated!

## Help us translate

While Organized already supports many languages, we're always looking to expand to be available for as many brothers and sisters as possible. If you speak a language that's not yet represented in Organized, we'd be really glad if you could help with translations. You can contribute through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/organized), a user-friendly platform that makes the translation process easy and straightforward. Your translated text will be included in the next app release, helping Organized reach even more congregations around the world.

The translation process is not complicated. Simply:
1. Create a Crowdin account, 
2. Open the Organized [translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/organized),
3. Start translating. 

For better understanding, please view our short [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG5q_NkfD6s) about the Organized translation process using Crowdin.

If you would like to add a language that is not yet present on Crowdin, please open [a new Issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=i18n&projects=&template=new_language_request.yml&title=%5BLanguage%5D+-+New+Language+Request) on our GitHub repository page and we will add it as soon as possible. You will be asked to fill out some of key tranlations to your language. By doing so, we can teach an AI model to translate the whole application, and then you will be able to simply proofread everything instead of translating string by string from scratch..

## So, how to get in touch?

If you decide to contact us and propose your assistance in any of the mentioned areas, you can send us an email at [support@organized-app.com](mailto:support@organized-app.com). Please mention the area of collaboration in your email topic. 

If you already have great ideas, feel free to share them on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/discussions).
