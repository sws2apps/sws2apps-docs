# Contact Organized support

Our support is happy to help you, if you're facing any issues with the app that are not yet covered in this How to use guide articles. There are two ways to reach us out.

## Open an Issue on GitHub

If you encounter a bug or have an idea for improving the Organized app, we encourage you to [submit an Issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub repository page. This is especially helpful if the issue or idea is relevant to other users as well.

By submitting an Issue, you can help us identify and fix problems more quickly, and include them to our roadmap. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we appreciate your help in making the Organized app the best it can be.

## Ask in our Telegram group

Our community is made up of our brotherhood who are happy to help and share their experiences using the app. You can join our official [Sheduling Workbox System Telegram chat](https://t.me/+cSAJmkiVneQwNjQ8) and ask your questios in the English topic/subchat, or a one in your lagnuage if it exists.
