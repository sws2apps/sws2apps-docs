# Documentation website for Scheduling Workbox System

Welcome to the sws2apps-docs repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for all documentation related to the sws2apps team and our various applications.

## Repository Overview

The repository is divided into two main sections:

1. **`organized`: [Organized App guide](https://guide.organized-app.com/app-overview/welcome-to-organized)**: This section contains comprehensive guides for each of our applications. The guides are organized into different folders based on the application they pertain to. Each folder contains a `custom.css` file for styling and a `/docs` folder where you can find "How to use" guide articles.


2. **`orgs`: [sws2apps team documentation](http://sws2apps.com)**: Similar to the app's related guide section, this directory has its own folder with a `custom.css` file and a `/docs` folder for articles.

## Creating a New Article

To create a new article, follow these simple steps:

1. Choose the appropriate folder for your article. If a suitable category doesn't exist, feel free to create a new category folder.

2. Inside the chosen folder, create a new `.md` file. This file will serve as your article.

3. Write your article using standard Markdown formatting. Adding screenshots is highly welcome.

4. Once you've finished writing, submit a pull request. Our team will review your article and, upon approval, merge it into the main repository. Your article will then be added to the website.
