## Is CPE an official applications from the organization?

No, it is not. You are free to choose whether to use our applications or not. But we strongly recommend all the congregation elders approved their use. Also, we are aware that there are many similar applications currently available to help you to accomplish similar tasks. We are not here to say what is the best and what is not. We believe all of these applications are good and have their own methods on how to do things, but still share the same goal.

## Why we choose to develop web application?

We believe that moving from desktop application to web application offers more advantages and flexibility. Web applications do not depend on system or hardware specifications. You can launch them from any platform or device that has a browser. It doesn’t matter whether you work with Windows, Mac, Linux, or a Smartphone. However, we also understand that there are some security risk involved when using web application. But be assured that we are doing our best to secure our application. We try to be up to date with all changes and developments in web technologies to provide you an application that you can rely on.
