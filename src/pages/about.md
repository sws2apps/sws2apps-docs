# About Us

The Scheduling Workbox System was created to assist congregations of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses with their tasks. Our sws2apps name reflects that we convert the different workbox tools into user-friendly applications for theocratic usage.

We build modern web applications and tools to simplify the work of the brothers in their congregations. Our team members are enthusiastic publishers who serve in different countries in different fields of service. We donate **our** time for other brothers and sisters to save **their**.

## Support us

Our applications are completely **free.** üòâ But building and maintaining an application is definitely not easy and involves time, energy and costs. Therefore, we really appreciate the generosity of those who support our work by donating any comfortable amount of money. All funds go only to maintaining and improving our software products.
