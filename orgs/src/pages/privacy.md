During registration, after you consent the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, we ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as:

- **Email address**: For account management and potential customer support communication.
- **First name and last name**: Used for registration and providing customer support.
- **Usage Data**: Includes information such as:
  - **IP address**: Used to analyze user behavior and troubleshoot issues.
  - **Browser type and version**: Helps us optimize our service for different browsers.
  - **Device information**: Unique device identifiers for security, usage analytics and for simplified login experience.

#### Information from Third-Party Social Media Services
If you register through third-party services like Google, Twitter, GitHub, or others provided, we collect some basic data linked to your account on those platforms. Specifically, we are collecting the email address, first and last name, and profile picture that are associated with your account. We collect them only to perform login and then display your name, email, and profile picture in your profile within the app.

### Use of Your Personal Data
We use your data for purposes such as:
- Maintaining and improving the Service.
- Managing your account and providing customer support.
- Sending updates and important notifications.
- Conducting analysis to enhance our services.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
We retain your data only for as long as it is necessary to provide you with the services described in this policy. Account-related data is kept until: a) you choose to delete your account, b) you request your congregation administrator to remove your data from the congregation records, or c) your congregation is completely deleted from the application. Usage Data is generally kept for a shorter period unless required for legal reasons.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information might be transferred to servers outside your country due to the use of essential global services required for the app to function, such as synchronization (optional) and authorization. This occurs only if you choose to use the data synchronization feature. Even when this happens, all data is securely encrypted, making it inaccessible to anyone, including the service provider, us, or any third party.

If you're using data synchronization within or between congregations (for example, sharing outgoing speakers lists), the data remains accessible only to authorized individuals within your congregation or the receiving congregation. This complies with GDPR regulations, ensuring your data is protected. Rest assured, we take strong precautions to safeguard your data and comply with all relevant privacy laws, regardless of where it's stored.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. You can request, update, amend, or delete your information by accessing your account settings, for certain cases by requesting the removal from your congregation's app administrator or elders, or by contacting us directly:

1. **Your Basic Login and Device Data**: You can request, update, amend, or delete this data by contacting us directly.
2. **Your Personal Information Entered into the App**: You can manage this information by accessing your account settings within the app.
3. **Data Entered by Your Elders**: We do not have access to this data. To request its removal, please contact the elders in your congregation directly.
4. **Deleting Your Entire Congregation’s Data**: To request the deletion of your entire congregation's data, you can either navigate to the settings within the app or contact us directly.


## Security of Your Personal Data

We are committed to protecting your interactions with our Products and Services by implementing robust security measures. This includes:

- **SSL/TLS Protection**: All data transmitted between your device and our servers is secured using SSL/TLS encryption, which provides a secure connection and protects against interception.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All congregation data is protected with end-to-end encryption by default. Data is encrypted before being synced or sent to our servers using Google Firebase, ensuring that even if intercepted, it cannot be accessed without the encryption key. For enhanced security, elders and ministerial servants have additional layers of encryption. Data is encrypted with the congregation’s key and is stored only if synchronization within the congregation is enabled. Without the proper encryption keys, the data remains inaccessible, even if physical access is gained.
- **App PIN Code**: Users can secure their accounts with a personal PIN code for added protection.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: We offer two-factor authentication to provide an extra layer of security every time when accessing your account.
- **One-Time Invitation Code**: Access to the app can be secured with one-time invitation codes to ensure that only authorized users can join.
- **Advanced User Access Control**: We implement advanced user access controls to manage permissions and ensure that any data is only accessible by authorized individuals.

These measures collectively ensure that your data is protected to the highest standard, maintaining your privacy and security.

## Compliance with Global Privacy Standards and GDPR
For us, it’s important to provide our services to congregations worldwide. Therefore, we do all that we can to comply with strict personal data privacy laws like GDPR and other regional privacy regulations. 

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Organized acts as a data processor, meaning it processes personal data on behalf of data controllers, such as congregations or organizations. The data controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data, while Organized simply follows their instructions. As a data processor, Organized ensures the security and confidentiality of the personal data it handles, implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it. Organized processes personal data solely to provide services, improve functionality, or meet legal obligations, in strict compliance with the GDPR, and does not use the data for any other purposes without the explicit direction of the data controller.

Organized ensures compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations through:
- **Data Management**: Ability to permanently delete individual or congregational data at any time.
- **Trusted Partners**: We use GDPR-compliant services like Google Firebase. For details on Firebase’s data protection practices, visit their [privacy policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) page.
- **Strong Security for Users and Developers:** We have implemented numerous security measures to ensure that only authorized access is available to all user types. For the development team, we adhere to high security standards, implementing the latest security best practices and regularly updating the software to align with current cybersecurity standards.

These measures collectively ensure that your data is protected to the highest standard, maintaining your privacy and security.

## Disclosure of Your Personal Data
In rare and exceptional situations, we may need to share your personal data. This section explains the rare situations in which your personal data might be disclosed, ensuring that such disclosures occur with full transparency and only when absolutely necessary due to legal requirements or other exceptional circumstances. Such disclosures are strictly necessary due to legal requirements or exceptional circumstances. Organized does not have access to congregation data entered by elders in the app. Therefore, the only information that might be shared in the following situations would be limited to your email address, the name used during registration, and your device ID or IP address.

### Changes in Project Operations
If Organized undergoes significant changes, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data might be transferred as part of that process. We will notify you in advance if this occurs and inform you if your data will be governed by a new Privacy Policy.

### Law Enforcement
In certain unique situations, we may be legally required to transfer your personal data. This includes instances where we receive formal requests from law enforcement or government agencies, such as courts or regulatory bodies, which may require us to provide information for legal reasons.

### Other Legal Requirements
We may also disclose your personal data to:
- Comply with legal obligations.
- Protect our rights or property.
- Address or prevent issues related to the Service.
- Ensure the safety of our users or the public.
- Manage legal risks.

We are committed to handling any data requests with the utmost care and transparency, always prioritizing your privacy.
